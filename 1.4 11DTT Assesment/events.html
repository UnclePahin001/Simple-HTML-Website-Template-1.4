                             <p> Due to ongoing border restrictions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, TEG Dainty has announced that KINGS OF LEON’S March & April 2022 tour of Australia and New Zealand is being rescheduled and the new dates will be confirmed soon. </p>
                              <p> Due to exceptional demand, Kings of Leon are delighted to announce a second & final Auckland show, scheduled for SPCA National Stadium on Tuesday 22nd March, joining the already announced and sold out Wednesday 23 March show. Performing to their New Zealand fans for the first time in over 12 years, the set will include songs from all 8 of their albums </p>

                    <h3>Jimmy Barnes | 7th May 2022</h3>
                    <p>Jimmy will now be touring Aotearoa next May with his 8-piece band in support of his latest album Flesh And Blood which debuted at #6 on the Official NZ Top 40.
                        <p>Due to the venue change, you will receive a new ticket for this event closer to show day.

Only the original credit card holder will receive a refund</p>

                    <h3>Midnight Oil | 13th May 2022</h3>
                    <p>Resist will be a fitting, forward looking, statement for a band whose clarion call has always been “it’s better to die on your feet than live on your knees”. </p>
                        <p>The tour will see them performing classic Midnight Oil songs from across their repertoire while also showcasing some urgent new works. As the title makes abundantly clear, Resist engages with the issues of today, like the lead single “Rising Seas” which tackles the climate crisis in typically uncompromising fashion</p>
